# Access Control

Due to the permissionless nature of decentralized databases, it is essential to have control over who can interact with your database. WeaveDB has a powerful mechanism to precisely set up any advanced logic to your database instance by combining [JsonLogic](https://jsonlogic.com/) and [FPJSON](https://fpjson.weavedb.dev)

Access control rules are as important as the schemas for decentralized database. WeaveDB rules are extremely powerful using [JsonLogic](https://jsonlogic.com/) with an original add-on that enables JSON-based [ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) functional programming.

Add rules to a collection:

```js copy
const rules = {
  let: {
    id: [
      "join",
      ":",
      [
        { var: "resource.newData.article_id" },
        { var: "resource.newData.user_address" },
      ],
    ],
  },
  "allow create": {
    and: [
      { "!=": [{ var: "request.auth.signer" }, null] },
      {
        "==": [{ var: "resource.id" }, { var: "id" }],
      },
      {
        "==": [
          { var: "request.auth.signer" },
          { var: "resource.newData.user_address" },
        ],
      },
      {
        "==": [
          { var: "request.block.timestamp" },
          { var: "resource.newData.date" },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  "allow delete": {
    "!=": [
      { var: "request.auth.signer" },
      { var: "resource.newData.user_address" },
    ],
  },
}
await db.setRules(rules, "bookmarks")
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
In the following sample code, `db` represents the state variable of your database instance. For reference, see [Initialize WeaveDB](/quick-start#initialize-weavedb)
</Callout>

Within the rules object, each top level key defines one rule. The keys should be a combination of (`allow` or `deny`) and (`write` or `create` or `update` or `delete`).

You can set up rules to either the entire write operation with `write` or specific operations such as `create`, `update` and `delete`.

`allow write` is equivalent to `allow create,update,delete`

So `write` = `create` + `update` + `delete`

Within the rules, you can access [various information](/sdk/rules#preset-variables) about the contract, block, transaction, and data to be uploaded.

```js copy
{
  contract: { id, owners },
  request: {
    auth: { signer, relayer, jobID, extra },
    block: { height, timestamp },
    transaction: { id },
    resource: { data },
    id,
    path,
  },
  resource: { data, setter, newData, id, path },
}
```

## Preset Variables

You can access various data within the validation blocks.

```js copy
const data = {
  contract: { id, owners },
  request: {
    auth: { signer, relayer, jobID, extra },
    block: { height, timestamp },
    transaction: { id },
    resource: { data },
    id,
    path,
  },
  resource: { data, setter, newData, id, path },
}
```

And with JsonLogic, you can use `var` to access variables, such as `{var: "resource.newData.user"}` to access the `user` field of the newly updated data.

`resource.setter` is the data creator. The following ensures only the original data creators can update their own data:

To combine multiple operations, chain them with `,` like `allow create,update`

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
`signer` will always be lowercase if it's an EVM wallet address. WeaveDB contract converts everything to lowercase to use them internally.

In regard to Arweave wallet addresses, the case will be retained, because it's RSA hashes and the case matters.
</Callout>

#### contract

- `id` : contractTxId
- `owners` : contract owners, equivalent to `getOwner()`

#### request

- `auth` : `signer` of the query, and relayer info (`relayer` / `jobID` / `extra`)
- `block` : block info
- `transaction` : transaction info
- `resource` : `data` in the query
- `id` : doc id
- `path` : collection / doc path

#### resource

- `data` : data before this query
- `newData` : data after this query
- `id` : doc id
- `path` : collection / doc path
- `setter` : original creator of the doc

### Modify Updated Data

You can amend the updated data before it's stored by modifying `newData` in access control rules.

For example always add `signer` address field as `address` field.

```js copy
const rules = {
  let : { "resource.newData.address" : { var: "request.auth.signer" } },
  "allow create" : true
}
await db.setRules(rules, "people", { ar : arweave_wallet })
```

If you set `{ name : "Bob"}` with wallet `0xABC`, the stored data will be `{ name : "Bob", address : "0xABC" }`.

```js copy
await db.set({ name : "Bob" }, "people", "Bob")
expect(await db.get("people", "Bob")).to.eql({name : "Bob", address: "0xABC" }) // true
```

### Get Other Data

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Feature added in contract version 0.28.15
</Callout>

You can also execute `get` query in `let` variable assignments. Use the syntax `["get", [QUERY]]`.

The following will first get `Bob` from `ppl` collection and assign it to `user`, then set `age` field with the user's age.

```js
const rules = {
  "let create" : { "user" : ["get", ["ppl", "Bob"]], "resource.newData.age": {var: "user.age"} },
  "allow create" : true
}
```

### Conditional Statements

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Feature added in contract version 0.28.16
</Callout>

`if` and `ifelse` can be used for conditional statements in access control rules.

```js
// assigning age=20 if the name is Bob
const rules = {
  "let create" : { 
    "resource.newData.age" : ["if", ["equals", "Bob", {var: "resource.newData.name"}], 20] 
  },
  "allow create" : true
}

// assigning age=20 if the name is Bob, and age=30 otherwise
const rules = {
  "let create" : { 
    "resource.newData.age" : ["ifelse", ["equals", "Bob", {var: "resource.newData.name"}], 20, 30] 
  },
  "allow create" : true
}
```

### Renaming Method

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Feature added in contract version 0.28.16
</Callout>

You can rename `request.method` to something other than `create` / `update` / `delete` and assign rules to the renamed method for beter branching.

```js
// rename method to create_bob if the name is Bob, and only allow create_bob
const rules = {
  "let create" : { 
    "request.method" : ["if", ["equals", "Bob", {var: "resource.newData.name"}], "create_bob"] 
  },
  "allow create_bob" : true
}
```

## Add-on: JSON-based Functional Programming
Javascript functions cannot be passed and stored with Warp contracts. So WeaveDB invented a powerful & simple way to do functional programming using JSON objects. You can use most of the [ramda](https://ramdajs.com) functions, which enables highly complex logics for access controls and data validations.

Within the rules object, you can define variables under `let` key and later use them within `allow/deny` validation blocks.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
By default, `let` will execute on create, update, and delete SDK operation. You can specify which operation/s you want `let` to be executed.

`"let create": { }` will execute only when creating a new document from the collection.

`"let create,update": { }` will execute only when creating and updating a document from the collection.

</Callout>

```js copy
const rules = {
  let: {
    id: [
      "join",
      ":",
      [
        { var: "resource.newData.article_id" },
        { var: "resource.newData.user_address" },
      ],
    ],
  },
  ...
}
```
For example, above is equivalent to

```js copy
const id = join(":", [ resource.newData.article_id, resource.newData.user_address ])
```
and later forcing doc ids to be `article_id:user_address` with JsonLogic.

```js copy
{
  "==": [{ var: "resource.id" }, { var: "id" }],
}
```
