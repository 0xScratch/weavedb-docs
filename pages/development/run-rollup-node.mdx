# Run Rollup Node

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
WeaveDB rollup is in early development. Please use it with caution and check for bugs.
</Callout>

This guide will help you set up rollup-based contracts. We are actively developing a Rollup-as-a-Service solution. For now, you will need to run your own rollup locally.

Once you have configured and thoroughly tested your database settings in this [guide](/development/run-local-test), you can deploy the database to a local rollup node.

## Generate Test Accounts

You can generate crypto accounts with `yarn keygen`
You will need at least 3 EVM accounts for rollup `admin`, DB contract `owner`, and `user`  
and 1 Arweave account for rollup `bundler`.  
Go to your project root directory.

```bash copy
yarn keygen admin
yarn keygen owner
yarn keygen user
yarn keygen bundler -t ar # for Arweave account
```

The generated accounts are stored under `/.weavedb/accounts`.  
List the accounts.

```bash
yarn accounts
```

You can also import existing accounts in `/weavedb.config.js`.
