# Run a Local Rollup Node

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
WeaveDB rollup is in early development. Please use it with caution and check for bugs.
</Callout>

This guide will help you set up rollup-based contracts. We are actively developing a Rollup-as-a-Service solution. For now, you will need to run your own rollup locally.

Once you have configured and thoroughly tested your database settings in this [guide](/development/run-local-test), you can deploy the database to a local rollup node.

## Set up Wallet Accounts

You'll need several types of accounts: 3 EVM accounts for the roles of rollup `admin`, database contract `owner`, and `user`, along with 1 Arweave account for the rollup `bundler`

There are two ways to set up these accounts:

1. Generate new accounts using the `yarn keygen` command.
2. Import existing accounts by configuring them in `/weavedb.config.js`

### Generate Accounts

In this example, we will generate new accounts. Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and execute the following commands:

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn keygen admin
yarn keygen owner
yarn keygen user
yarn keygen bundler -t ar # for Arweave account
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm keygen admin
npm keygen owner
npm keygen user
npm keygen bundler -t ar # for Arweave account
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### List Accounts

The generated accounts are stored under `/.weavedb/accounts`

Execute the following command in your terminal to show a list of accounts. Make sure the terminal is in your project's root directory. 

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn accounts
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm accounts
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Clone WeaveDB Repo

Open a new terminal, then, execute the following command to clone the WeaveDB repository and install the dependencies. Make sure the terminal is in a new directory outside of your project's root directory.

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/weavedb/weavedb.git
cd weavedb
yarn
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/weavedb/weavedb.git
cd weavedb
npm install
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Write Configuration

1. Open the WeaveDB repo in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

2. Navigate to `/grpc-node/node-server/` directory and create a new file named `weavedb.standalone.config.js` if it does not already exist.

3. Copy the default configuration below and paste it in `weavedb.standalone.config.js` file.

```js copy filename="/grpc-node/node-server/weavedb.standalone.config.js"
module.exports = {
  admin: "admin_private_key",
  bundler: { /* Arweave bundler account */ },
  rollups: { }, // this can be empty or pre-defined
}
```

4. Locate the `bundler.json` file in your project, found at `/your_project/.weavedb/accounts/ar/bundler.json`. Copy its entire content and paste it as the value for `bundler` in your `weavedb.standalone.config.js` file.

5. Next, locate the `admin.json` file, found at `/your_project/.weavedb/accounts/evm/admin.json`. Copy the `privateKey` from this file and paste it as the string value for `admin` in your `weavedb.standalone.config.js` file.

Note: `your_project` refers to the project name you've set up earlier in this [guide](/development/run-local-test#create-a-project).
</Callout>

## Run Rollup Node

Before proceeding, make sure that `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed and running on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from [Docker's official site](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker).

To run the rollup node, open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your WeaveDB repo, and execute the following command:

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn run-rollup
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm run-rollup
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After successful execution, your local rollup node will be available to receive queries at `localhost:8080`

## Deploy the Database

The next step is to deploy a database instance after running your local rollup node.

1. Open your [project](/development/run-local-test#create-a-project) in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor, then open the `weavedb.config.js` file and replace the string value of your database `name` with a name you prefer.

2. Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal, then execute the following commands:

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
Replace `db_name` with the name you provided in the `weavedb.config.js` file
</Callout>


<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn deploy db_name --owner owner
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm deploy db_name --owner owner
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then, configure the instance with the database settings.

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn setup db_name --owner owner
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm setup db_name --owner owner
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now your database is all set and deployed in your local rollup node!

## Run Test Script

You can create and execute scripts using `weavedb-node-client` to interact with your database and familiarize yourself with its operations.

1. Open your [project](/development/run-local-test#create-a-project) in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

2. Create a new file called `demo.js` in your `scripts` folder if it does not already exist.

3. Copy the example script provided below into your `demo.js` file. This script shows how to add, fetch, and delete posts from the database.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
Replace `db_name` with the name of the database you specified earlier.
</Callout>

```js copy filename="/scripts/demo.js"
const SDK = require("weavedb-node-client")
const accounts = require("./lib/accounts")

const main = async key => {
  const COLLECTION_NAME = "posts"

  const userAuth = { privateKey: accounts.evm.user.privateKey }
  const db = new SDK({ rpc: "localhost:8080", contractTxId: "db_name" })

  // add a post
  const tx = await db.query("add:post", { body: "test" }, COLLECTION_NAME, userAuth)

  // fetch posts
  console.log(await db.get(COLLECTION_NAME))

  // delete the recently added post
  await db.query("delete:post", COLLECTION_NAME, tx.docID, userAuth)

  process.exit()
}

main()
```

4. Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal, and run the script with the following command. It will add a post, fetch the list of posts, and then delete the post.

```bash copy
node scripts/demo.js
```

You can review the transactions in the explorer by visiting [scan.weavedb.dev/node/localhost/db/db_name](http://scan.weavedb.dev/node/localhost/db/db_name)

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
Make sure you replace `db_name` at the end of the URL with the actual name of the database you specified earlier.
