# Run Rollup Node

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
WeaveDB rollup is in early development. Please use it with caution and check for bugs.
</Callout>

This guide will help you set up rollup-based contracts. We are actively developing a Rollup-as-a-Service solution. For now, you will need to run your own rollup locally.

Once you have configured and thoroughly tested your database settings in this [guide](/development/run-local-test), you can deploy the database to a local rollup node.

## Set up Wallet Accounts

You'll need several types of accounts: 3 EVM accounts for the roles of rollup `admin`, database contract `owner`, and `user`, along with 1 Arweave account for the rollup `bundler`

There are two ways to set up these accounts:

1. Generate new accounts using the `yarn keygen` command.
2. Import existing accounts by configuring them in `/weavedb.config.js`

### Generate Accounts

In this example, we will generate new accounts. Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and execute the following commands:

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn keygen admin
yarn keygen owner
yarn keygen user
yarn keygen bundler -t ar # for Arweave account
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm keygen admin
npm keygen owner
npm keygen user
npm keygen bundler -t ar # for Arweave account
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### List Accounts

The generated accounts are stored under `/.weavedb/accounts`

Execute the following command in your terminal to show a list of accounts. Make sure the terminal is in your project's root directory. 

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn accounts
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm accounts
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Clone WeaveDB Repo

Open a new terminal, then, execute the following command to clone the WeaveDB repository and install the dependencies. Make sure the terminal is in a new directory outside of your project's root directory.

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/weavedb/weavedb.git
cd weavedb
yarn
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/weavedb/weavedb.git
cd weavedb
npm install
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Write Configuration

1. Open the WeaveDB repo in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

2. Navigate to `/grpc-node/node-server/` directory and create a new file named `weavedb.standalone.config.js` if it does not already exist.

3. Copy the default configuration below and paste it in `weavedb.standalone.config.js` file.

```js copy filename="/grpc-node/node-server/weavedb.standalone.config.js"
module.exports = {
  admin: "admin_private_key",
  bundler: { /* Arweave bundler account */ },
  rollups: { }, // this can be empty or pre-defined
}
```

4. Locate the `bundler.json` file in your project, found at `/your_project/.weavedb/accounts/ar/bundler.json`. Copy its entire content and paste it as the value for `bundler` in your `weavedb.standalone.config.js` file.

5. Next, locate the `admin.json` file, found at `/your_project/.weavedb/accounts/evm/admin.json`. Copy the `privateKey` from this file and paste it as the string value for `admin` in your `weavedb.standalone.config.js` file.

Note: `your_project` refers to the project name you've set up earlier in this [guide](/development/run-local-test#create-a-project).

## Run Rollup Node

Before proceeding, make sure that `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from [Docker's official site](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker).

To run the rollup node, open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your WeaveDB repo, and execute the following command:

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn run-rollup
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm run-rollup
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After successful execution, the rollup node will be available to receive queries at `localhost:8080`
