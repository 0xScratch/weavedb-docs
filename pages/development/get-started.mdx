# Get Started with WeaveDB Rollup

This guide helps you set up up rollup-based contracts using WeaveDB and its command-line tools.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm must be installed

## Test Locally with WeaveDB Tools

- `weavedb-tools` is a command-line utility. It provides a set of commands to facilitate the process of setting up a local WeaveDB instance.

- Before deploying your WeaveDB instance to the main network, it is recommended to first deploy it locally on your machine for testing. This will help you catch any issues early on, reducing risks in your production environment.

### Install WeaveDB Tools

```bash copy
sudo npm -g install weavedb-tools
```

Now, you can use the `weavedb` global command.

### Create a Project

```bash
weavedb create your_project
cd your_project
```
