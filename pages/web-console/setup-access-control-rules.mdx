# Set up Access Control Rules

Using the [web console](https://console.weavedb.dev/), navigate to the `Access Control Rules` section in the side menu, select your collection from the list, then click the edit icon in the top right corner of the `Rules` box.

In this example, we define a rule for the `people` collection. This rule allows anyone to create a new document in the collection and ensures that only the original data creators can update their own data.
```js copy filename="Rules"
{
  "allow create": true,
  "allow update": {
    "==": [{ var: "request.auth.signer" }, { var: "resource.setter" }]
  }
}
```

 You can copy & paste the rules object above to the popped-up textarea and click `Add`.

Now if you try to update an existing data with another wallet, the transaction will fail.
