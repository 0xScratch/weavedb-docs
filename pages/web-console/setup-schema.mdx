# Set up Data Schema

Using the [web console](https://console.weavedb.dev/), navigate to the `Schema` section in the side menu, select your collection from the list, then click the edit icon in the top right corner of the `Schemas` box.

In this example, we are defining a schema for the `people` collection, which dictates that the document must be an object and should include required fields for `name` (with a data type of string) and `age` (with a data type of number).

```js copy filename="Schema"
{
  type: "object",
  required: ["name", "age"],
  properties: {
    name: { type: "string" },
    age: { type: "number" }
  }
}
```

You can copy & paste the schema object above to the popped-up textarea and click `Add`.

With the defined schema, you cannot add a document that violates the schema requirements. For example: 

```bash copy filename="Web Console Terminal"
set {name:123,age:"Bob"} people Bob
```
