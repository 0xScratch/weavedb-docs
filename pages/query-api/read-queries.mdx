# Read Queries

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
In the following sample code, `db` represents the state variable of your database instance. For reference, see [Initialize WeaveDB](/quick-start#initialize-weavedb)

`collection_name` refers to the string value that contains the name of your collection, and `doc_id` refers to the string value that contains the unique identifier of a document from the collection.
</Callout>

## get / cget

Fetches data from the database collection. The `get` query returns only the data, while `cget` also provides metadata of the documents.

The following is the metadata format returned by `cget` :

```js filename="metadata"
{ id, setter, data, block: { height, timestamp } }
```

The metadata returned with `cget` functions as a cursor for pagination.

### Fetch a single document

Use `get` or `cget` to fetch a single document from a collection. `cget` additionally returns document metadata.

<Tabs items={['get', 'cget']}>
  <Tab>  
    ```js copy
    await db.get(collection_name, doc_id)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```js copy
    await db.cget(collection_name, doc_id)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Fetch all documents in a collection

Use `get` or `cget` to fetch all documents from a collection. `cget` additionally returns document metadata.

<Tabs items={['get', 'cget']}>
  <Tab>
    ```js copy
    await db.get(collection_name)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```js copy
    await db.cget(collection_name)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Fetch documents from a sub collection

Arbitrary levels of document nesting are supported, allowing access to subcollection documents.

```js copy
await db.get(collection_name, doc_id, "sub_collection_name_1", "sub_doc_id_1", "sub_collection_name_2")
```

### Limit

Limits the number of documents returned from a collection. By specifying a number after the collection name, you can control how many documents are fetched.

```js copy
await db.get(collection_name, 5)
```

### Sort

Sorts the documents in a collection based on a specified field and order. Supports both ascending and descending order.


#### Descending order

In this example, documents in the collection are sorted by `age` in descending order.

```js copy
await db.get(collection_name, [ "age", "desc" ])
```

#### Ascending order

In this example, the `age` field is sorted in ascending order by default because the second element in the array is not defined.

```js copy
await db.get(collection_name, [ "age" ])
```

#### Multiple fields

In this example, documents in the collection are sorted by `age` in descending order, then sorted by `name` in ascending order.

```js copy
await db.get(collection_name, [ "age", "desc" ], [ "name", "asc" ])
```

### Where

Retrieves documents from a collection based on specific query conditions. Supports a range of operators for flexible querying.

The following example returns all documents where the `age` field is greater than 20.


```js copy
await db.get(collection_name, ["age"], [ "age", ">", 20 ])
```

`==` `>` `>=` `<` `<=` `!=` `in` `not-in` `array-contains`, and `array-contains-any` are supported.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
Dot notation can be used to specify nested object fields. (e.g. `[ "favorites.food", "==", "apple" ]`)
 
Note that dot notation only works with `where` operation for now.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
`=` is deprecated and replaced by `==` at `v0.23.0`. You can still use it for backward compatibility.
</Callout>

### Skip

Enables skipping over a specified number of documents, useful for implementing pagination or bypassing previously processed data.

`startAt`, `startAfter`, `endAt`, and `endAfter` are supported.

- `startAt` : Start fetching documents from a specific value.
- `startAfter` : Fetch documents beginning immediately after a specific value.
- `endAt` : Fetch documents up to and including a specific value.
- `endAfter` : Fetch documents up to, including, and the one after a specific value.

#### Skip with limit range

The following example will sort the documents from the collection using the `age` field in ascending order. It will then start fetching documents from the collection where the `age` is greater than 20 but less than or equal to 60.

```js copy
await db.get(collection_name, [ "age" ], [ "startAfter", 20 ], [ "endAt", 60 ])
```

#### Skip with a specific start point

The following example will sort the documents from the collection using the `age` field in ascending order, then by the `name` field in descending order. The documents to be fetched will start after the first document where the `age` is 20 and `name` is "Bob".

```js copy
await db.get(
  collection_name,
  ["age"],
  ["name", "desc"],
  ["startAfter", 20, "Bob"]
)
```

### Pagination

Manages the retrieval of documents in pages, making it easier to handle large datasets.

```js copy
const docs_page1 = await db.cget(collection_name, [ "age" ])
const docs_page2 = await db.cget(collection_name, [ "age" ], ["startAfter", docs_page1[docs_page1.length - 1]])
```

## getNonce

To get the next nonce for an address. Nonces are internally used for signature verification to write data.

```js copy
await db.getNonce("address")
```

## getIds

To get the last added doc id, use `getIds`.

```js copy
const tx = await db.add({ age: 20, name: "Bob" }, collection_name)
const doc_id = (await db.getIds(tx))[0]
```

## on / con

You can subscribe to state changes with `on` and `con`. They are the counterparts of `get` and `cget` respectively.

These only work with `weavedb-sdk-node` for now.

```js
const unsubscribe = await on.(collection_name, doc_id, (data) => {
  console.log(data)
  unsubscribe()
})
```

## getCache / cgetCache

They are the same as `get` / `cget`, but get values from the cached state, which is faster but may not be the most up-to-date values.

These only work with `weavedb-sdk-node` for now.

```js
await db.getCache(collection_name, doc_id)
await db.cgetCache(collection_name, doc_id)
```

## listCollections

List collection names

```js copy
await db.listCollections() // list root collections
await db.listCollections(collection_name, doc_id) // list sub collections
```
