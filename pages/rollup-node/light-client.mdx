# Light Client

The light client simplifies browser interactions with the Warp SD. It eliminates the need for storing a full cache, leading to much faster read queries.

To use the light client, a remote rollup node associated with the database instance is necessary. You will need to specify the endpoint URL as `rpc`

## For Web Browsers

### Install

From the root directory of your project, run the following command in the terminal to install `weavedb-client`

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn add weavedb-client
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm install weavedb-client
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Instantiate

Import WeaveDB Module

```js copy
import WeaveDB from "weavedb-client"
```

Create a WeaveDB Instance

```js copy
const db = new WeaveDB({
  contractTxId: WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID, // Replace WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID with your deployed database contract on the rollup node
  rpc: "http://xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa:8080" // Replace with your rollup node URL
})
```

You can start reading and writing to your WeaveDB instance as soon as it is instantiated.

## For NodeJS

### Install

From the root directory of your project, run the following command in the terminal to install `weavedb-node-client`

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn add weavedb-node-client
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm install weavedb-node-client
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Instantiate

Import WeaveDB Module

```js copy
const WeaveDB = require("weavedb-node-client")
```

Create a WeaveDB Instance

```js copy
const db = new WeaveDB({
  contractTxId: WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID, // Replace WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID with your deployed database contract on the rollup node
  rpc: "0.0.0.0:8080" // Replace with your rollup node's IP and port
})
```

#### Secure Port

It also works with remote secure ports such as `example.com:443`

```js copy
const WeaveDB = require("weavedb-node-client")

const db = new WeaveDB({
  contractTxId: WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID, // Replace WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID with your deployed database contract on the rollup node
  rpc: "example.com:443"
})
```

or


```js copy
const WeaveDB = require("weavedb-node-client")

const db = new WeaveDB({
  contractTxId: WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID, // Replace WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID with your deployed database contract on the rollup node
  rpc: "example.com",
  secure: true, // optional
  cert: YOUR_CERT // optional
})
```

You can start reading and writing to your WeaveDB instance as soon as it is instantiated.
