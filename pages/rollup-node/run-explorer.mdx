# Run WeaveDB Scan Explorer

WeaveDB repository needs to be cloned to your local machine. For instructions, see [this guide](/development/clone-the-repo)

From the root directory of your local [WeaveDB repo](/development/clone-the-repo), run the following command in the terminal to navigate to the directory at `/weavedb/explorer`

```bash copy
cd explorer
```

Then execute the following commands in the terminal to install the dependencies and run the app on your localhost

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
yarn
yarn dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
npm install
npm run dev
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now WeaveDB Scan Explorer is running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You can also conveniently access the publicly deployed WeaveDB Scan Explorer at [scan.weavedb.dev](https://scan.weavedb.dev)
